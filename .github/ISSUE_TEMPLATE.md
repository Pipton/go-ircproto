I found that the program crashes if you define the state of the universe as 43,
instead of 42.

### Version and Platform Information

<!--Delete as appropriate-->
**OS**: Linux/Mac/BSD/Windows<br>
<!--Mac/Windows users; remove this. BSD/Linux users; replace with your
    flavour/distro-->
**Flavour**: Ubuntu<br>
<!--Replace with your OS version -->
**Version**: 15.10<br>
<!--Linux/BSD/Mac users; run 'uname -srmpo' in a terminal and put the single
    line of output here. Windows users; delete this-->
**Uname Output:** blah<br>

### How to Reproduce

I can cause the problem to occur again if I do:

<!-- Give appropriate steps here -->
1.   Reload the universe with the `--state` flag set to 43.
2.   Run this program.
3.   It should crash now.
