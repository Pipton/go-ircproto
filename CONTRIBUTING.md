# How to Contribute

So, you want to contribute? Excellent! All you need to know is written below,
although it's pretty standard stuff. If you have any questions or problems, feel
free to message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SnowyBoop).

## Reporting Bugs

Before doing anything, please verify that the bug has not already been reported
by searching through the [Issue List](https://github.com/AelitaStyles/go-ircproto/issues).

### It Exists and is Open

In that case, the first thing you'll want to do is use [GitHub Reactions](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
to +1 it; do not leave comments such as "I have this bug too!". If you have any
additional information you'd like to contribute to the issue, please do.

### It Exists and is Closed

OK, while I'm sure you have already done so, please verify that the version you
are using includes the changes pertaining to that issue. If it doesn't, you'll
just have to be patient and wait for the next release.

If it does, please leave a comment with the version number you are using, and
any additional information you feel would be useful. We'll review the issue as
soon as possible.

### It Doesn't Exist

In that case, please create an issue ASAP! Give it a short title that describes
the problem (e.g. "Crashes when universe state set to 43"), and fill in the
form. If you feel we are asking for something that isn't relevant, feel free to
remove it.

In the end, you should have provided information explaining what the problem is,
the current version you are using, what platform you are on, and how to
reproduce the problem.

## Suggesting Features

Awesome! We'd love to hear your suggestions, but before you do anything, go
check the [Issue List](https://github.com/AelitaStyles/go-ircproto/issues)
to see if someone hasn't beaten you to it.

If someone has, simply use [GitHub Reactions](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
to +1 it. If you'd like to add anything, feel free to leave a comment.

If nobody has suggested something similar to your idea, go create a new issue.
Give it a short title that describes you idea (e.g. "Add function to obtain
cake"), and replace the body of the issue with a detailed explanation of what
you'd like.

## Submitting Changes

Before you write any code, make sure you are familiar with the [Go Coding
Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). When creating commits,
make sure they are small and atomic, and make sure you write [good commit
messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Also please [sign your
commits using GPG](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work),
we like to know it's actually you!

Once you are ready to merge your changes, open up a pull request. Give it an
appropriate title, and fill in the form. Once we've looked at your pull request,
we'll either accept it, or provide further instructions.
